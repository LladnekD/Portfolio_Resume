          <h3>Westwood Driving School</h3>
          <p>This was a redesign for a driving school I worked for, a company that had been in business for over 25 years at the time, I began helping with minor elements on the existing site, and with SEO for the business. I was finally able to do a full redesign for the site, and this was one of the designs I made for the company. They wanted to maintain a simple color scheme and design. I did a few redesigns for them. This site uses JS, specifically JQuery, I'd started working with it around this time so I wanted to use it for a few elements of the site, I added modal windows for logging in, and using with other media elements of the site</p>

          <h3>Westwood Driving School</h3>
          <p>This was the final redesign I did for Westwood Driving School. I took elements from the first redesign and added a bit more to make it modern, adding the slides for quick relevant information This design incorporated elements from the area, the background photo is a local photo, there was an added element to switch out background pictures, as well as being mobile ready as well. The site used JS(JQuery) for other elements like modal windows for signing up for classes, showing videos, Added Google Map features also to display traffic in the Los Angeles Area to figure out optimal practice for driving times.</p>
